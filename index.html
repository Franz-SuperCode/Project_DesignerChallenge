                    <h2>Every idea starts with a need</h2>
                    <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills
                        and
                        attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only
                        on
                        paper
                        and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                        sense
                        with
                        what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface,
                        I
                        really
                        liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve
                        any
                        problem.
